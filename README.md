## Installation
To run the code in this project, Anaconda 23.1.0 and Python 3.10.10 must be installed. Libraries and frameworks can be installed in a virtual environment through the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
source /path/to/anaconda3/bin/activate /path/to/anaconda3/envs/your_vitual_enviroment
```

conda install --file requirements.txt
```
## Download datasets
Data can be downloaded at this [link](https://seafile.cloud.uni-hannover.de/d/18bc6da305bd46fca62e/) and should be located right in this directory, only if you pull the code from gitea.
Otherwise you can download the entire work including code, data and pretrained model via the [link](https://seafile.cloud.uni-hannover.de/d/2d9dec930be54e4b9ba5/).
## Visualize
The visualize folder is where data can be visualized. The name of each file corresponds to the appropriate time series-to-image Encoding. In addition, the file raw.ipynb is raw data in time series form and scaled.ipynb is a normalized time series.
